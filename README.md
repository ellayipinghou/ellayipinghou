## Hi, I'm Ella! 👋
#### 🎓 Junior at Tufts University, studying Computer Science

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, whether that’s developing web applications, building AI models, or crafting efficient software solutions. I’m always pushing myself to learn more and grow as a developer, and I believe that hands-on experience is key to improving. Right now, I'm diving deep into AI/ML through the Break Through Tech program @ MIT, where I’m exploring cutting-edge techniques in the full ML workflow — from data preprocessing, to model development, to evaluation and refinement. I’m always looking for new ways to apply my skills in real-world projects and continue learning from others in the field. Got any exciting opportunities? Let’s connect!
