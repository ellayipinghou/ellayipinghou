I‚Äôm passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, whether that‚Äôs developing web applications, building AI models, or crafting efficient software solutions. Right now, I'm diving deep into AI/ML through the Break Through Tech program @ MIT, where I‚Äôm exploring cutting-edge techniques in the full ML workflow ‚Äî from data preprocessing, to model development, to evaluation and refinement. I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to apply my skills in real-world projects and continue learning from others in the field. Got any exciting opportunities? Let‚Äôs connect!
